		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage">Luke Cage Website</a>
		<p>The only page I could find about Luke Cage was his Wikipedia page. The elements were familiar but I did not know what the script element is. My guess is that it runs a script from another file</p> 
		<p>Whats good about Wikipedia is that it gives you all the information that you can find in an orderly way.</p>
